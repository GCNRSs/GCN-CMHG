# GCN-CMHG
This is an implementation of GCN-CMHG. 
# Introduction
GCN-CMHG is a recommendation algorithm that proposed in our paper "A Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Recommendation Based on Community Detection and the Combination of Multiple Heterogeneous Graphs". 
By combining the Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) layer with the Heterogeneous Partial Adjacent Auxiliary (HPAA) layer constructed using community detection algorithm, GCN-CMHG can help any node in the user-iteminteraction heterogeneous graph obtain distant information with less time loss, and finally improve the recommendation effect.
